# This is a wrapper script for the pacdiff tool from the pacman-contrib
# package. The main features of this script are the following:
#  - it allows kdiff3 to be used as the diff and merge program for pacdiff;
#  - it makes pacdiff's three-way diff and merge features work for both
#    official and AUR packages at the same time, even if these two sets of
#    packages are cached in different directories;
#  - it invokes pacdiff with some arguments that I want to be enabled by
#    default.

    # subsequent saved versions correctly overwrite the previous ones, rather
    # than being concatenated after them.
