# Cargo commands receive the command name (in this case, 'update-installed') as
# the `$1` argument, and `cargo help <command>` calls the specified command
# with '--help' as the `$2` argument. Print the help when `$1` is '-h'/'--help'
# (in case the user calls this script directly, rather than through cargo), or,
# for simplicity, whenever there are any arguments after `$1`.
